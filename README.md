# Risk_accident_prediction
This is the work that i have done in a kaggle competition to predict using a regression model  the risk accident.

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Simulated Roads Accident dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
